# Code book for summarized_data.txt
# Original data from the UCI HAR dataset
# This file contains a summary of the UCI HAR data

# All columns contain an average (mean) of the 
# mean or standard deviation (std) of all measurements
# for the given subject while performing the given activity

# Features measured by the accelerometer are in standard gravity units (g)
# Features measured by the gyroscope are in units of radians/second

subject - an integer identifying the subject (1-30)
activity - a description of the activity being performed
